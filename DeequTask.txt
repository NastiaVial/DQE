Hello Deequ task.

In this task you will setup environment for running PyDeequ and perform basic profiling and verification of data from "AdventureWorks2012" database (also you can use DB "TRN" from Module 1).

# Environment setup:
1. Install Docker on Windows https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/
2. Clone repository https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks
3. Rebuild docker "pyspark-notebook" image to support spark 3.0.0 version for PyDeequ needs according to instructions: https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/specifics.html
"docker build --rm --force-rm -t jupyter/pyspark-notebook:spark-3.0.0 ./pyspark-notebook --build-arg spark_version=3.0.0 --build-arg spark_checksum=bfe45406c67cc4ae00411ad18cc438f51e7d4b6f14eb61e7bf6b5450897c2e8d3ab020152657c0239f253735c263512ffabf538ac5b9fffa38b8295736a9c387"
4. Run rebuilt docker image:
"docker run -v %cd%:/home/jovyan/work -p 8888:8888 -p 4040:4040 --user root -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes --name pyspark jupyter/pyspark-notebook"
5. Copy nessessary JDBC driver to running Docker container for the further usage.

#Task:
1. Run pyspark-notebook docker container and open Deequ_pySpark_skeleton.ipynb notebook.
2. In this notebook connect to MS SQL DB from SQL Module and using PyDeequ perform:
- data analyzing
- data profiling
- constraints suggestion
- constraints verification
3. Make as beautiful test report as you can for constraints verification step (csv, html, etc.)

# Expected output:
Git project on git.epam.com with .ipynb file (with your output included) and test report example.
Please add meaninfull comments in the notebook about what you did and why.

# Grades:
1. Environment setup is successful, connection to DB is established - 30 points
2. Final Deequ_pySpark_skeleton.ipynb is well structured and all sections work just fine on mentors machine - 40 points
3. Test report is present and easy to use - 20 points.
4. Code is following PEP8 recommendations - 10 points.

Pass grade is 80.
